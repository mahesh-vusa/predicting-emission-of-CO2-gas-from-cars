PROJECT-CO2 EMISSIONS
Introduction: Predicting the emission of Co2 is important in the automobile sector .a company should be able to estimate the emission of co2 from the different vehicles that are producing and to pass the pollution control board tests. Data Science and predictive analytics play an important role in building models that can be used to predict the Co2 emission. In this project, we are provided with a data set fuel.csv containing 880 data points. Each data point represents a Co2 emission, and three features are provided as follows: 
 Target set: 
 The column with header “Co2 emissions” indicates the tailpipe emissions of carbon dioxide (in grams per kilometre) for combined city and highway driving.  
 Features set: 
 The column with header “cylinders” indicates the number of cylinders in a vehicle.  The column with header “Engine size” indicates the capacity of engine in litres.  The column with header “Comb” indicates City and highway fuel consumption ratings are shown in litres per 100 kilometres (L/100 km) - the combined rating (55% city, 45% high way) is shown in L/100 km.
